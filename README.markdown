This is the code for a two different versions of a 3 species theoretical metacommunity.  Its rules
are based on competition / colonization trade-off rules.
A talk describing the rules used can be found here http://www.slideshare.net/DistribEcology/modeling-metacommunties
There are two verisions, one with simple visualizations in NetLogo and a full version in R. 

Usage:

```R
$ Rscript Agent_Based_Metacommunity.R 10
```

This will run the model for 10 time steps
